// You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

export function findOutlier(integers) {
  const even = integers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0)
  const odd = integers.filter((num) => num % 2 !== 0)
  return even.length === 1 ? even[0] : odd[0]
}
